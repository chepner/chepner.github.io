<p>My wife wondered why Taco Tuesday was a thing, but not Fajita Friday.</p>

<p>(You can guess what we’re having for dinner this week.)</p>

<p>I thought maybe it had to do with meter.</p>

<p>Taco and Tuesday are both <em>trochees</em>: a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable.</p>

<p><em>Ta</em>co <em>Tues</em>day.</p>

<p>Fajita Friday, on the other hand, doesn’t seem quite as nice. I’m no poet, but I <em>think</em> you would
describe its scansion as being a pair of iambs (unstressed-stressed), but with <em>enjambment</em>, an
incomplete foot at the end.</p>

<p>Fa<em>ji</em>ta <em>Fri</em>day.</p>
