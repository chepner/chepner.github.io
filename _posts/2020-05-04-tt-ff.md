title: Fajita Friday

My wife wondered why Taco Tuesday was a thing, but not Fajita Friday.

(You can guess what we're having for dinner this week.)

I thought maybe it had to do with meter.

Taco and Tuesday are both *trochees*: a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable.

*Ta*co *Tues*day.

Fajita Friday, on the other hand, doesn't seem quite as nice. I'm no poet, but I *think* you would
describe its scansion as being a pair of iambs (unstressed-stressed), but with *enjambment*, an
incomplete foot at the end. 

Fa*ji*ta *Fri*day.
